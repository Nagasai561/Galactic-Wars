Basic Instructions:
1. Use arrow keys to move the spaceship
2. Use spacebar to shoot bullets
3. You can wrap around the edges

You can read rules of the game here. But I would suggest you to discover the rules of game by yourself.
Rules:
1. If a monster reaches the left end of screen, you lose
2. If a monster touches your spaceship, you lose
3. (For only medium and hard levels) The bullets can also wrap around. You lose if you get hit by your own bullets.
