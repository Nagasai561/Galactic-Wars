## Basic Instructions:
1. Use arrow keys to move the spaceship
2. Use spacebar to shoot bullets
3. You can wrap around the edges



### You can read rules of the game here. But I would suggest you to discover the rules of game by yourself.

## Rules:
1. If a monster reaches the left end of screen, you lose
2. If a monster touches your spaceship, you lose
3. (For only medium and hard levels) The bullets can also wrap around. You lose if you get hit by your own bullets.



## Troubleshooting:
1. Too small/big screen?? Follow below steps:
    1. Open "driver.py" file
    2. In line 7, there is a variable called "screen_size". Increase or decrease it, according to your liking.

2. "File not found" error:
    Use "cd" command to change the current directory in the terminal to "Galactic-Wars" and then try to run "driver.py".
